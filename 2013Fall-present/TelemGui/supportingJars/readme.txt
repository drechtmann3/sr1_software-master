In order to make this code work on your machine, either copy the .jars to 
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45\jre\lib\ext and also to C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib\ext
or compile with the -cp flag to include these libraries in your classpath.

If Linux, make sure to use the linux jars. Copy to JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext.
