Overview
	Customizable screen, where the user can select from a variety of options, what they want on the home screen
	i.e. 	speed limit set
			Overall voltage
			GPS map
			Wireless radio status
			Notes
			etc.

Strategy
	GPS data linked with google maps/earth, combined with race route and traffic info
	wether forcasts, in projected areas
	Estimates on power remaining, run time etc
	Notes on race route

Motor
	Pedal positions
	Current speed
	Speed limit set (speed limiter)
	Fault codes
	Airgap position
	Other usefull motor information

Batteries/BMS
	Graphical overview of batteries (green for good, yellow for warning, and red for disabled)
	per battery, or smallest unit available, voltage, and current
	Pack overviews, voltage and current
	Expected run time remaing
	Graph of voltage over time
	Faults

Solar/MPPT
	Per array voltage and current (x4)
	current output voltage
	Faults

Telemetry
	Wireless radio status (connected, signal level)
	Wireless radio power level (control)
	View of the LCD screens
	Blinker status
	Brake light status
	Graph over time of selected sensors, preferably 8 at a time (channels 1-32)
	current values of all ADC inputs (channels 1-32)
	Faults
	
Advanced
	8 fully customizable graphs, where you can select to see the variable value(s) vs any other values or time
		ie. Graph 1 (battery 1 and 2 voltages vs pack 1 amperage)
			Graph 2 (battery 5 voltage vs time)
			etc.

Notes
	Needs the ability to log and fetch, large quantities of data quickly
	The goal of this program, is to be as modular and flexable as possible.
		The input data, and variables need to be able to be changed quickly
		The UI should be very customizable, so it can fit our race strategy and planning
			I.E. We only have one person to drive the chase car, and they also need to be monitoring telem data
	Audible alarms are needed for major errors
	The screen size should scale to the display being used. For instance, the size of the graphs and windows should scale, so that they are proportionatly the same on a 18" monitor, as a 13" monitor
